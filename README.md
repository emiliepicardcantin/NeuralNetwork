# Dataset
The primary dataset used in the multi-class classification is a collection of pictures of ASL letters on a white background. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet).

Note that the test dataset was not sufficient for my short-term needs, so I split the given training dataset into two separate parts.
